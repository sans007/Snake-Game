# Snake-Game

**Introduction:**    

Snake Game is a video game that originated during the late 1970s in arcades becoming something of a classic. It became the standard pre-loaded game on Nokia phones in 1998. The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows.

**Rules are as follows:**
1. Use arrow keys to move the snake.
2. Food will be provided at random coordinates of the screen.
3. Every time the snake eats the food, the length of the snake will be increased by 1 element and thus the score.
4. Game will get over if there occurs a collision of the snake with the wall or with itself.

**Program Code:**    

This is entirely written in cpp language.
